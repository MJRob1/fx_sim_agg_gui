//! # FX Simulator and Aggregator - fx_sim_agg_gui
//!
//! `fx_sim_agg_gui` simulates FX market data streams and aggregates them into a real-time book of buys and sells.
//! A separate thread renders the FX updates in real-time to a GUI.
//!
//! - `main.rs`  Defines and initiates the UI runtime (which in turn intiates the asynchronous fx simuation and aggregation runtime). Also initiates log4rs logging framework
//! - `simulator.rs` generates simulated FX market data and sends the data as asynchronous market data streams
//! - `aggregator.rs` updates and aggregates the asynchronous data streams into a real-time FX book of buys and sells
//! - `lib.rs` Includes the thread which combines all the individual asynchronous market data streams from each liquidity provider into a single merged stream
//! that yields values in the order they arrive from the source market data streams. Also incudes the FxViewerApp structure which initiates and updates the GUI.
//! Various utilities used by the other modules are also in this library.
//! - `gui.rs` Contains the definition of the GUI components and how to render them.
